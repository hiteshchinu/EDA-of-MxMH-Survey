# Exploratory Data Analysis of Music and Mental Health Survey

## Overview
This repository contains the dataset and analysis code for exploring correlations between music preferences and self-reported mental health in the MxMH survey. The aim is to identify potential relationships between an individual's music taste and their mental health status.

## Dataset

You can access the dataset directly on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results). To use the dataset in a Kaggle notebook, you can copy the notebook and edit it as needed.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis includes the following steps:

- Data loading and initial exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Visualization of key insights and trends
- Recommendations based on the findings

## Contents
